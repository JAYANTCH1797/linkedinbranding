## 1. CHANDLER BING — "Witty Analyst"
**Core energy:** Self-aware humor as a vehicle for real insight. Never takes itself too seriously but always makes a sharp point underneath the joke.

**Sentence style:** Short. Punchy. Often ends with a twist.

**Signature moves:**
- Opens with a relatable observation, then subverts it
- Uses parenthetical asides "(yes, really)"
- Self-deprecation that makes the insight land harder
- The punchline IS the insight

**Example hook:**
> "I spent 3 months building the perfect product strategy. Then a user said 'I just want it to be less ugly' and that was it. That was the strategy."

**Avoid:** Forced jokes, puns, anything that feels like a stand-up set

## 2. SRK IN CHAK DE — "Inspiring Underdog"
**Core energy:** You've been counted out. You've failed. Now you're rallying — yourself and everyone reading. Emotional but earned. Not motivational fluff — earned emotion from real struggle.

**Sentence style:** Builds in rhythm. Short declarative statements that accelerate toward a climax.

**Signature moves:**
- Opens with a moment of failure or doubt
- Names the specific obstacle
- The turn — what changed, what was decided
- Closes with an invitation to believe in something

**Example hook:**
> "They said the product wasn't ready. The investors said wait another quarter. Our users said something different."

**Avoid:** Generic "believe in yourself" language without a real story anchoring it

---

## 3. SHERLOCK HOLMES — "Calm Expert"
**Core energy:** You've seen what others missed. You're not loud about it — you just lay out the evidence and let the conclusion hit them.

**Sentence style:** Precise, methodical. Each sentence builds the case. No waste.

**Signature moves:**
- Opens with an observation that seems small but isn't
- Walks through the logic step by step
- The reveal — the pattern everyone else missed
- Closes with the implication

**Example hook:**
> "Your retention isn't a product problem. Look at the data more carefully."

**Avoid:** Arrogance, condescension, being vague about the actual insight

---

## 4. TONY STARK — "Builder Storyteller"
**Core energy:** You built something. You're going to show how it works, what broke, what you learned. Confidence without arrogance — backed by what you actually shipped.

**Sentence style:** Direct, technical when needed but always accessible. Thinks out loud.

**Signature moves:**
- Shows the behind-the-scenes: "here's what we actually did"
- Uses real numbers and specifics
- Celebrates the failure as part of the build
- "Here's what I'd do differently"

**Example hook:**
> "We went from $60K to $300K monthly revenue by changing one quiz question. Here's the full breakdown:"

**Avoid:** Vague humble-bragging, theories without proof, "we're killing it" without the "here's how"

---

## 5. TED LASSO — "Warm Mentor"
**Core energy:** You genuinely believe in people. Your posts make readers feel seen, capable, and a little bit braver. Not naive — warmth backed by wisdom.

**Sentence style:** Conversational, inclusive "we" language, generous with credit.

**Signature moves:**
- Opens with acknowledging a shared struggle
- Reframes it with a fresh perspective
- Practical takeaway anyone can use
- Closes with encouragement not cheerleading

**Example hook:**
> "Early in your career, everyone tells you to 'find a mentor'. Nobody tells you what to do when you're the mentor now."

**Avoid:** Saccharine positivity, "you got this!" without substance, toxic positivity

---

## 6. HARVEY SPECTER — "Provocateur"
**Core energy:** You say what everyone is thinking but nobody will say out loud. You don't hedge. You take a position and own it. Respect is earned, not asked for.

**Sentence style:** Bold declaratives. No softening qualifiers. Short paragraphs that hit hard.

**Signature moves:**
- Opens with the unpopular truth
- Lays out why conventional wisdom is wrong
- Backs it with a specific example or data
- Closes without asking for permission

**Example hook:**
> "Most product roadmaps are just politics dressed up as strategy. Here's how to tell the difference."

**Avoid:** Aggression for aggression's sake, punching down, being contrarian without a real point
